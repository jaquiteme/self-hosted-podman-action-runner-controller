# Container Engine Actions Runner Controller (CE-ARC)

A lightweight autoscaling self‑hosted GitHub runners with podman or docker

# About

CE-ARC is a lightweight solution to automatically scale and provision self-hosted GitHub Actions runners based on queued jobs for podman. This repository provides a server written in Go that listen to GitHub workflow Webhook events, register runners to a GitHub organization or repository, and a Dockerfile to build GitHub runners containers image.

## Why this project

- I build this tool to serve my own purposes, primarly because I mainly use GiHub Saas and need a simple solution to run jobs that require a deployment or to access my home-lab infrastructure. But its also can fit small teams and individuals who has similar needs.

- But also running your self-hosted runner could reduce CI wait time by adding runners when workflows queue.

## Core components

- A server configure once and listen to GitHub webhook, check events integrity and automatically provision and register runners as needed.
